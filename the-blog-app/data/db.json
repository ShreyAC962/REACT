The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "To start honestly, at this point in my “food blog journey” and yes I did just use that phrase, I just take it as it comes. I’ve found after yeeears of doing this (coming up on 4 years to be exact, so I’m basically a blog grandma) that I can write with the most authentic voice if I’m just true to whatever I feel like writing about. It sounds most natural, it’s easy to write, it comes across as authentic. Because it is.\n\nThe problem comes when I don’t feel like writing about anything, and in that case, I hole up in bed with a jar of Nutella.",

      "title": "The Best Walking Tours in Amsterdam",
      "body": "Amsterdam is one of my favorite cities in the world. I’ve been visiting it regularly for over a decade and even spent some time living there. It’s a city with a misunderstood reputation, often glossed over as simply a place to party and partake in the illicit Red Light District.\n\nBut Amsterdam has so much more to offer.\n\nIf you want to explore the city, there are really only two ways to get around: biking and walking. And fortunately, for those who like to walk (and/or bike) the Dutch capital offers a legion of picturesque strolls: along leafy canals, past centuries-old churches and cozy canal houses, and down narrow cobblestoned lanes.\n\nTo really get a glimpse below the city’s surface, take a walking tour. I take them in every city I visit. They’re the best way to learn about the history and culture while connecting with an expert local guide who can share their tips and insight.\n\nAmsterdam, unsurprisingly, offers an array of unique tours: from sex worker-led tours through the famed Red Light District to tours that explore the city’s recreational drug culture to strolls that focus on the history of the city.",

      "title": "The Best Airline Credit Cards",
      "body": "After over 14 years of traveling the world, I’ve lost count of how many free flights and upgrades I’ve had. Thanks to travel hacking, I’ve been able to enjoy free flights, free hotel stays, upgrades, lounge access, and more — all without any extra spending.\n\nOne of the main tools that has helped me accomplish this is having a points earning airline credit card.\n\nWhile the perks of airline cards aren’t often as impressive as high-end travel cards (like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, for example), you always want to have the card of a few airlines so you have free bags, extra points per dollar spent, lounge access, and more.\n\nAirline credit cards are pretty straight forward: they are co-branded cards meant to incentivize users to stay loyal to one airline. By giving you extra points when you spend with airlines as well as bonuses when you hit certain spending milestones, airlines want you to use their card as often as possible.\n\nThere are two rules to know when picking an airline credit card: first, always get the card of the airline you fly the most. You always want the perks that come with it. Second, when looking for a new card, go with the biggest bonus. Once you have the card of your favorite airline, when you want another, find one that has a big bonus since you’re just using it for the points for a free flight not because you’re loyal.",
